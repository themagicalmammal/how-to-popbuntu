## Controlling Audio Devices

Pavucontrol is one of the most well-known audio managers for PulseAudio.

### Music playback

In Playback tab, here is a list of all apps that are using your audio system. To mute all System sounds, press the speaker icon in System Sounds. You can also drag the audio slider to adjust the audio.

But, this tab only shows applications currently using audio. Like in this example, I was listening to Spotify.
