## Disable annoying Keyring
### This provides security for browsers on an autologin-based system. (Easy way to understand it)
If you have an autologin system, whenever you open a browser (except firefox) or Github-desktop, the system asks for a key.  
**Steps to Disable it:**
```settings
App password & keys > Login > Change Password > Type your Current Pass > Continue > Continue with Empty Pass > Make unencrypted
```

## Controlling Audio Devices
Pavucontrol is one of the most well-known audio managers for PulseAudio.

### Music playback
In Playback tab, here is a list of all apps that are using your audio system.  To mute all System sounds, press the speaker icon in System Sounds. You can also drag the audio slider to adjust the audio. 

But, this tab only shows applications currently using audio. Like in this example, I was listening to Spotify.

### Recording adjuster
