# Office
I directly use Chrome extension for the office, which you can get [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/editor-for-docs-sheets-sl/eahibemoondbjaojgcdnmjlnbjmgbbml)  
**If you have not tried LibreOffice, I will recommend you to try it first.** 
Alternatives,
## 1. [Free Office](https://www.freeoffice.com/en/)
Looks like Microsoft Office 2016. 
Get the deb file [here](https://www.freeoffice.com/en/download/applications)
## 2. [OnlyOffice](https://www.onlyoffice.com/)
Looks like Microsoft Office 2013. 
Get the deb file [here](https://www.onlyoffice.com/en/download-desktop.aspx)
## 3. [WPS Office](https://www.wps.com/)
### If you have a problem with Chinese apps or are privacy concerns skip over this.
This is a beautiful office suite with lots of customization. 
Get the deb file [here](https://linux.wps.com/) 

## You can also use web-based offices like Google Drive.
### To remove LibreOffice
```bash
sudo apt-get autoremove --purge libreoffice* -y
```
