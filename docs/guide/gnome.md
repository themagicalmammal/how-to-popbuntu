## Minimize Button and Button Placement

Minimize is an important button. While I think you can live without it if you use the Super key a lot. But, for me, the minimize button seems to be very useful.
You can get the maximize button too, but it's not that useful because it can be done by double-clicking the title bar.
If you were a Mac user, you might prefer left button placement over the default right placement.
**Note:** Left Placement glitches the gnome-tweak-tool for some reason don't worry about it just increase the size of the window.

## Optimizing Font

I use custom resolution on my PC's so the font seems small to me, so it makes it better I use 1.11x font. I have set the hinting to full because hinting makes the font appear crisper so that they are more readable. Also, I have set the anti-aliasing to full pixels instead of sub-pixels because it has more font smoothing.

## Activity Hot Corner and Format time

The activity hot corner enables the hot corner where the button Activity is placed. So rather than clicking the button just touch the edge.
You can format time according to what you need. I only use the time, so I got rid of the date there.
