# Preferred Apps

The majority of Linux distributions have their own apps that are made to fit their style, however here are some of the ones that I have grown accustomed to over the years.

## Bedrock Linux

Bedrock Linux is a meta Linux distribution which allows users to mix-and-match components from other, typically incompatible distributions. Bedrock integrates these components into one largely cohesive system.

For example, one could have:

- Debian's stable coreutils
- Arch's cutting edge kernel
- Void's runit init system
- A pdf reader with custom patches automatically maintained by Gentoo's portage
- A font from Arch's AUR
- Games running against Ubuntu's libraries
- Business software running against CentOS's libraries
- All at the same time and working together mostly as though they were packaged for the same distribution.

## Snap Vs Flatpak (External Package Managers)

Compared to Flatpak, Snap can support more apps. It operates as intended by the creator. Some even go so far as to claim that "Snap is the future." However, Flatpak now beats Snap, which is why I don't choose Snap, but it's still up to you.

::: warning
If you are a newbie I won't recommend you remove snap. But, if you want to remove snap you can go [here](https://www.kevin-custer.com/blog/disabling-snaps-in-ubuntu-20-04/)
