# Preferred Apps

The majority of Linux distributions have their own apps that are made to fit their style, however here are some of the ones that I have grown accustomed to over the years.

## Snap Vs Flatpak (Package Managers except apt, dpkg)

Compared to Flatpak, Snap can support more apps. It operates as intended by the creator. Some even go so far as to claim that "Snap is the future." However, Flatpak now beats Snap, which is why I don't choose Snap, but it's still up to you.

::: warning
**If you are a newbie I won't recommend you remove snap.**
