# Preferred Apps
Pop has apps that you need. But, if you do not like them, you can also get alternatives.

## Snap Vs Flatpak (Package Managers except apt, dpkg)
Snap can incorporate more apps than Flatpak. It runs how the developer wants it to. Some even say go as far as to say, "Snap is the future". But, currently, Flatpak outperforms Snap, for the most part, that is why I don't prefer Snap but, still, it's your choice. 

**If you are a newbie I won't recommend you remove snap.**
